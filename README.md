# About Me #

Hello.

My projects are not necessarily good ideas, nor are they always the best way to solve a particular problem. This is nothing more than a fun hobby for me, so a lot of what I make is actually me trying to do something a specific way, just to see if I can.

For help, questions, or if you just wanna tell me that my code sucks, feel free to open an issue in the relevant repository, and I will respond as soon as I am able. You can also email me at the public email listed on my profile, or DM me on Twitter.
